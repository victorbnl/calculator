# Calculator

Calculator is a simple calculator made for me to learn. It's not especially intended to be used but if it fits your needs, feel free to use or even fork it!

It's made in Qt using PySide

## Dependencies

- PySide 6
- cx_Freeze for building

## Building

To build it for Windows, just do `make windows`

You can also do `make all` to build it for all architectures but currently there is only Windows, please submit a pull request if you know how to build a PySide app to Linux
